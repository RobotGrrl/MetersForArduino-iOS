[Meters for Arduino](http://robotgrrl.com/apps4arduino/meters.php)
==================

Meters for Arduino brings back vintage memories of old VU Meters! Before LEDs were used to display volume units they used a magnoelectric meter that would move a pin around. You could measure the value using a scale that is painted on the back plate. VU Meters were originally quite slow to display the data.


##Usage

Meters for Arduino demonstrates how you can use [Wijourno](http://robotgrrl.com/apps4arduino/wijourno.php) to send the data from the Mac App to the iOS App.

If you are going to be using Meters for Arduino to build the application to use it as a standalone, then do a tweetware micro-action on [this page](http://robotgrrl.com/apps4arduino/meters.php) please. :)
